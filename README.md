# Stock_Market_Growth_Prediction_Using_Deep_Learning_Algorithm


Sure, here is a sample README file for a GitHub project on stock price prediction using LSTM:

Stock Price Prediction with LSTM
This project uses the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm to predict the stock price of a given company. The LSTM algorithm is a type of recurrent neural network that is well-suited for time series prediction problems.

The project is implemented in Python and uses the TensorFlow deep learning framework. The project is divided into the following steps:

Data collection: The project collects historical stock price data for the company of interest. The data is collected from a variety of sources, including Yahoo Finance and Google Finance.
Data preprocessing: The collected data is preprocessed to remove noise and improve the accuracy of the model. This includes steps such as filling in missing values, normalizing the data, and scaling the data.
Model training: The LSTM model is trained on the preprocessed data. The model is trained for a specified number of epochs using a supervised learning approach.
Model evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on a holdout dataset. The evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance include the root mean squared error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE).
Model prediction: The trained model is used to predict the stock price of the company of interest. The predictions are plotted as a graph to visualize the model's performance.
The project is available as an open-source project on GitHub. The project is easy to use and can be used to predict the stock price of any company.
